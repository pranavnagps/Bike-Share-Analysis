- Ride durations beyond 3471 seconds were outliers and hence omitted


## Exploration

- The top 10 start stations for both types of riders and for casual riders only were summarized
- Trends in ride duration and bike share service usage through the year were summarized


## Visualization
- Matplotlib and Seaborn were used for all visualizations in this project
- An additional visualization was created as a Tableau dashboard- [Bike Share Visualization](https://public.tableau.com/views/BikeShareAnalysis_16711166827110/BikeShareAnalysis?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)
